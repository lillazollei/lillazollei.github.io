Our lab works on various neuroimaging solutions related to human brain development. We are interested in MRI brain image analysis during the perinatal period and write tools to analyze both postmorterm and in vivo high resolution images. Our lab works at the nexus of many scientific disciplines to accomplish computational neuroimaging, and enjoys collaborating with people from various scientific backgrounds to achieve our results.


# Research Interests

The Zöllei Lab is pursuing research in algorithm development related to perinatal brain MRI image
analysis, both for in vivo and ex vivo acquisitions. We have focused a lot on
various spatial registration projects and also on diffusion weighted image
analysis.
