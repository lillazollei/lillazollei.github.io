Our lab works on various neuroimaging solutions related to human brain development. We are interested in MRI brain image analysis during the perinatal period and develop tools to analyze both postmorterm and in vivo high-resolution images. We work at the nexus of many scientific disciplines to accomplish computational neuroimaging, and enjoy collaborating with people from various scientific backgrounds to achieve our results.
