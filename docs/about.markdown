I am interested in algorithm development related to perinatal brain MRI image
analysis, both for in vivo and ex vivo acquisitions. I have focused a lot on
various spatial registration projects and also on diffusion weighted image
analysis.

neuroimaging). Find out more at [FitNG](https://groups.io/g/fitng) or follow us on

# About Dr. Jane Doe

Welcome to the website of Dr. Jane Doe, a researcher dedicated to advancing our understanding of infant brain development through the use of advanced imaging techniques.

Dr. Doe received her Ph.D. in Neuroscience from the University of California, Berkeley, where she specialized in the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the neural basis of cognitive development in infants and young children. Since then, she has continued to focus her research on using cutting-edge neuroimaging methods to explore how the developing brain processes information and learns new skills.

## Current Research

Dr. Doe's current work is focused on using high-resolution MRI to study the structural and functional connectivity of the developing brain, with a particular emphasis on understanding how early experiences shape neural development. Her research has been published in a number of top-tier academic journals, including *Nature Neuroscience* and the *Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience*, and she has been invited to present her findings at conferences around the world.

## Mentoring and Outreach

As part of her commitment to promoting scientific education and outreach, Dr. Doe is actively involved in mentoring graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, and she frequently collaborates with clinicians and educators to translate her research findings into practical interventions and programs for parents, caregivers, and educators.
