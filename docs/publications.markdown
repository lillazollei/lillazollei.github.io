The field of adult neuroimaging relies on well-established principles in
research design, imaging sequences, processing pipelines, as well as
safety and data collection protocols. The field of infant magnetic
resonance imaging, by comparison, is a young field with tremendous
scientific potential but continuously evolving standards. The present
article aims to initiate a constructive dialog between researchers who
grapple with the challenges and inherent limitations of a nascent field
and reviewers who evaluate their work. We address 20 questions that
researchers commonly receive from research ethics boards, grant, and
manuscript reviewers related to infant neuroimaging data collection,
safety protocols, study planning, imaging sequences, decisions related
to software and hardware, and data processing and sharing, while
acknowledging both the accomplishments of the field and areas of much
needed future advancements. This article reflects the cumulative
knowledge of experts in the FIT\'NG community and can act as a resource
for both researchers and reviewers alike seeking a deeper understanding
of the standards and tradeoffs involved in infant neuroimaging.

Fetal, infant, and toddler neuroimaging is commonly thought of as a
development of modern times (last two decades). Yet, this field
mobilized shortly after the discovery and implementation of MRI
technology. Here, we provide a review of the parallel advancements in
the fields of fetal, infant, and toddler neuroimaging, noting the shifts
from clinical to research use, and the ongoing challenges in this
fast-growing field. We chronicle the pioneering science of fetal,
infant, and toddler neuroimaging, highlighting the early studies that
set the stage for modern advances in imaging during this developmental
period, and the large-scale multi-site efforts which ultimately led to
the explosion of interest in the field today. Lastly, we consider the
growing pains of the community and the need for an academic society that
bridges expertise in developmental neuroscience, clinical science, as
well as computational and biomedical engineering, to ensure special
consideration of the vulnerable mother-offspring dyad (especially during
pregnancy), data quality, and image processing tools that are created,
rather than adapted, for the young brain.

The surface of the human cerebellar cortex is much more tightly folded
than the cerebral cortex. Volumetric analysis of cerebellar morphometry
in magnetic resonance imaging studies suffers from insufficient
resolution, and therefore has had limited impact on disease assessment.
Automatic serial polarization-sensitive optical coherence tomography
(as-PSOCT) is an emerging technique that offers the advantages of
microscopic resolution and volumetric reconstruction of large-scale
samples. In this study, we reconstructed multiple cubic centimeters of
ex vivo human cerebellum tissue using as-PSOCT. The morphometric and
optical properties of the cerebellar cortex across five subjects were
quantified. While the molecular and granular layers exhibited similar
mean thickness in the five subjects, the thickness varied greatly in the
granular layer within subjects. Layer-specific optical property remained
homogenous within individual subjects but showed higher cross-subject
variability than layer thickness. High-resolution volumetric morphometry
and optical property maps of human cerebellar cortex revealed by
as-PSOCT have great potential to advance our understanding of cerebellar
function and diseases.

Numerical body models of children are used for designing medical
devices, including but not limited to optical imaging, ultrasound, CT,
EEG/MEG, and MRI. These models are used in many clinical and
neuroscience research applications, such as radiation safety dosimetric
studies and source localization. Although several such adult models have
been reported, there are few reports of full-body pediatric models, and
those described have several limitations. Some, for example, are either
morphed from older children or do not have detailed segmentations. Here,
we introduce a 29-month-old male whole-body native numerical model,
\"MARTIN\", that includes 28 head and 86 body tissue compartments,
segmented directly from the high spatial resolution MRI and CT images.
An advanced auto-segmentation tool was used for the deep-brain
structures, whereas 3D Slicer was used to segment the non-brain
structures and to refine the segmentation for all of the tissue
compartments. Our MARTIN model was developed and validated using three
separate approaches, through an iterative process, as follows. First,
the calculated volumes, weights, and dimensions of selected structures
were adjusted and confirmed to be within 6% of the literature values for
the 2-3-year-old age-range. Second, all structural segmentations were
adjusted and confirmed by two experienced, sub-specialty certified
neuro-radiologists, also through an interactive process. Third, an
additional validation was performed with a Bloch simulator to create
synthetic MR image from our MARTIN model and compare the image contrast
of the resulting synthetic image with that of the original MRI data;
this resulted in a \"structural resemblance\" index of 0.97. Finally, we
used our model to perform pilot MRI safety simulations of an Active
Implantable Medical Device (AIMD) using a commercially available
software platform (Sim4Life), incorporating the latest International
Standards Organization guidelines. This model will be made available on
the Athinoula A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging website.

Intergenerational effects are described as the genetic, epigenetic, as
well as pre- and postnatal environmental influence parents have on their
offspring\'s behavior, cognition, and brain. During fetal brain
development, the primary cortical sulci emerge with a distinctive
folding pattern that are under strong genetic influence and show little
change of this pattern throughout postnatal brain development. We
examined intergenerational transmission of cortical sulcal patterns by
comparing primary sulcal patterns between children (N = 16, age
5.5 ± 0.81 years, 8 males) and their biological mothers (N = 15, age
39.72 ± 4.68 years) as well as between children and unrelated adult
females. Our graph-based sulcal pattern comparison method detected
stronger sulcal pattern similarity for child-mother pairs than
child-unrelated pairs, where higher similarity between child-mother
pairs was observed mostly for the right lobar regions. Our results also
show that child-mother versus child-unrelated pairs differ for daughters
and sons with a trend toward significance, particularly for the left
hemisphere lobar regions. This is the first study to reveal significant
intergenerational transmission of cortical sulcal patterns, and our
results have important implications for the study of the heritability of
complex behaviors, brain-based disorders, the identification of
biomarkers, and targets for interventions.

Supratentorial sensory perception, including pain, is subserved by the
trigeminal nerve, in particular, by the branches of its ophthalmic
division, which provide an extensive innervation of the dura mater and
of the major brain blood vessels. In addition, contrary to previous
assumptions, studies on awake patients during surgery have demonstrated
that the mechanical stimulation of the pia mater and small cerebral
vessels can also produce pain. The trigeminovascular system, located at
the interface between the nervous and vascular systems, is therefore
perfectly positioned to detect sensory inputs and influence blood flow
regulation. Despite the fact that it remains only partially understood,
the trigeminovascular system is most probably involved in several
pathologies, including very frequent ones such as migraine, or other
severe conditions, such as subarachnoid haemorrhage. The incomplete
knowledge about the exact roles of the trigeminal system in headache,
blood flow regulation, blood barrier permeability and trigemino-cardiac
reflex warrants for an increased investigation of the anatomy and
physiology of the trigeminal system. This translational review aims at
presenting comprehensive information about the dural and brain afferents
of the trigeminovascular system, in order to improve the understanding
of trigeminal cranial sensory perception and to spark a new field of
exploration for headache and other brain diseases.

Non-rigid cortical registration is an important and challenging task due
to the geometric complexity of the human cortex and the high degree of
inter-subject variability. A conventional solution is to use a spherical
representation of surface properties and perform registration by
aligning cortical folding patterns in that space. This strategy produces
accurate spatial alignment, but often requires high computational cost.
Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated the
potential to dramatically speed up volumetric registration. However, due
to distortions introduced by projecting a sphere to a 2D plane, a direct
application of recent learning-based methods to surfaces yields poor
results. In this study, we present SphereMorph, a diffeomorphic
registration framework for cortical surfaces using deep networks that
addresses these issues. SphereMorph uses a UNet-style network associated
with a spherical kernel to learn the displacement field and warps the
sphere using a modified spatial transformer layer. We propose a
resampling weight in computing the data fitting loss to account for
distortions introduced by polar projection, and demonstrate the
performance of our proposed method on two tasks, including cortical
parcellation and group-wise functional area alignment. The experiments
show that the proposed SphereMorph is capable of modeling the geometric
registration problem in a CNN framework and demonstrate superior
registration accuracy and computational efficiency. The source code of
SphereMorph will be released to the public upon acceptance of this

Prenatal exposure to methamphetamine is associated with neurostructural
changes, including alterations in white matter microstructure. This
study investigated the effects of methamphetamine exposure on
microstructure of global white matter networks in neonates. Pregnant
women were interviewed beginning in mid-pregnancy regarding their
methamphetamine use. Diffusion weighted imaging sets were acquired for
23 non-sedated neonates. White matter bundles associated with pairs of
target regions within five networks (commissural fibers, left and right
projection fibers, and left and right association fibers) were estimated
using probabilistic tractography, and fractional anisotropy (FA) and
diffusion measures determined within each connection. Multiple
regression analyses showed that increasing methamphetamine exposure was
significantly associated with reduced FA in all five networks, after
control for potential confounders. Increased exposure was associated
with lower axial diffusivity in the right association fiber network and
with increased radial diffusivity in the right projection and left and
right association fiber networks. Within the projection and association
networks a subset of individual connections showed a negative
correlation between FA and methamphetamine exposure. These findings are
consistent with previous reports in older children and demonstrate that
microstructural changes associated with methamphetamine exposure are
already detectable in neonates.

The development of automated tools for brain morphometric analysis in
infants has lagged significantly behind analogous tools for adults. This
gap reflects the greater challenges in this domain due to: 1) a
smaller-scaled region of interest, 2) increased motion corruption, 3)
regional changes in geometry due to heterochronous growth, and 4)
regional variations in contrast properties corresponding to ongoing
myelination and other maturation processes. Nevertheless, there is a
great need for automated image-processing tools to quantify differences
between infant groups and other individuals, because aberrant cortical
morphologic measurements (including volume, thickness, surface area, and
curvature) have been associated with neuropsychiatric, neurologic, and
developmental disorders in children. In this paper we present an
automated segmentation and surface extraction pipeline designed to
accommodate clinical MRI studies of infant brains in a population 0-2
year-olds. The algorithm relies on a single channel of T1-weighted MR
images to achieve automated segmentation of cortical and subcortical
brain areas, producing volumes of subcortical structures and surface
models of the cerebral cortex. We evaluated the algorithm both
qualitatively and quantitatively using manually labeled datasets,
relevant comparator software solutions cited in the literature, and
expert evaluations. The computational tools and atlases described in
this paper will be distributed to the research community as part of the
FreeSurfer image analysis package.

Anthropometric indicators, including stunting, underweight, and wasting,
have previously been associated with poor neurocognitive outcomes. This
link may exist because malnutrition and infection, which are known to
affect height and weight, also impact brain structure according to
animal models. However, a relationship between anthropometric indicators
and brain structural measures has not been tested yet, perhaps because
stunting, underweight, and wasting are uncommon in higher-resource
settings. Further, with diminished anthropometric growth prevalent in
low-resource settings, where biological and psychosocial hazards are
most severe, one might expect additional links between measures of
poverty, anthropometry, and brain structure. To begin to examine these
relationships, we conducted an MRI study in 2-3-month-old infants
growing up in the extremely impoverished urban setting of Dhaka,
Bangladesh. The sample size was relatively small because the challenges
of investigating infant brain structure in a low-resource setting needed
to be realized and resolved before introducing a larger cohort.
Initially, fifty-four infants underwent T1 sequences using 3T MRI, and
resulting structural images were segmented into gray and white matter
maps, which were carefully evaluated for accurate tissue labeling by a
pediatric neuroradiologist. Gray and white matter volumes from 29
infants (79 ​± ​10 days-of-age; F/M ​= ​12/17), whose segmentations were of
relatively high quality, were submitted to semi-partial correlation
analyses with stunting, underweight, and wasting, which were measured
using height-for-age (HAZ), weight-for-age (WAZ), and weight-for-height
(WHZ) scores. Positive semi-partial correlations (after adjusting for
chronological age and sex and correcting for multiple comparisons) were
observed between white matter volume and HAZ and WAZ; however, WHZ was
not correlated with any measure of brain volume. No associations were
observed between income-to-needs or maternal education and brain
volumetric measures, suggesting that measures of poverty were not
associated with total brain tissue volume in this sample. Overall, these
results provide the first link between diminished anthropometric growth
and white matter volume in infancy. Challenges of conducting a
developmental neuroimaging study in a low-resource country are also
described.

Childhood poverty has been associated with structural and functional
alterations in the developing brain. However, poverty does not alter
brain development directly, but acts through associated biological or
psychosocial risk factors (e.g. malnutrition, family conflict). Yet few
studies have investigated risk factors in the context of infant
neurodevelopment, and none have done so in low-resource settings such as
Bangladesh, where children are exposed to multiple, severe biological
and psychosocial hazards. In this feasibility and pilot study, usable
resting-state fMRI data were acquired in infants from extremely poor
(n = 16) and (relatively) more affluent (n = 16) families in Dhaka,
Bangladesh. Whole-brain intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) was
estimated using bilateral seeds in the amygdala, where iFC has shown
susceptibility to early life stress, and in sensory areas, which have
exhibited less susceptibility to early life hazards. Biological and
psychosocial risk factors were examined for associations with iFC. Three
resting-state networks were identified in within-group brain maps:
medial temporal/striatal, visual, and auditory networks. Infants from
extremely poor families compared with those from more affluent families
exhibited greater (i.e. less negative) iFC in precuneus for amygdala
seeds; however, no group differences in iFC were observed for sensory
area seeds. Height-for-age, a proxy for malnutrition/infection, was not
associated with amygdala/precuneus iFC, whereas prenatal family conflict
was positively correlated. Findings suggest that it is feasible to
conduct infant fMRI studies in low-resource settings. Challenges and
practical steps for successful implementations are discussed.

Many studies have investigated the development of face-, scene-, and
body-selective regions in the ventral visual pathway. This work has
primarily focused on comparing the size and univariate selectivity of
these neural regions in children versus adults. In contrast, very few
studies have investigated the developmental trajectory of more
distributed activation patterns within and across neural regions. Here,
we scanned both children (ages 5-7) and adults to test the hypothesis
that distributed representational patterns arise before category
selectivity (for faces, bodies, or scenes) in the ventral pathway.
Consistent with this hypothesis, we found mature representational
patterns in several ventral pathway regions (e.g., FFA, PPA, etc.), even
in children who showed no hint of univariate selectivity. These results
suggest that representational patterns emerge first in each region,
perhaps forming a scaffold upon which univariate category selectivity
can subsequently develop. More generally, our findings demonstrate an
important dissociation between category selectivity and distributed
response patterns, and raise questions about the relative roles of each
in development and adult cognition.

The normal development of thalamocortical connections plays a critical
role in shaping brain connectivity in the prenatal and postnatal
periods. Recent studies using advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
techniques in neonates and infants have shown that abnormal
thalamocortical connectivity is associated with adverse
neurodevelopmental outcomes. However, all these studies have focused on
a single neuroimaging modality, overlooking the dynamic relationship
between structure and function at this early stage. Here, we study the
relationship between structural and functional thalamocortical
connectivity patterns derived from healthy full-term infants scanned
with diffusion-weighted MRI and resting-state functional MRI within the
first weeks of life (mean gestational age = 39.3 ± 1.2 weeks; age at
scan = 24.2 ± 7.9 days). Our results show that while there is, in
general, good spatial agreement between both MRI modalities, there are
regional variations that are system-specific: regions involving
primary-sensory cortices exhibit greater structural/functional overlap,
whereas higher-order association areas such as temporal and posterior
parietal cortices show divergence in spatial patterns of each modality.
This variability illustrates the complementarity of both modalities and
highlights the importance of multimodal approaches.

The ongoing myelination of white-matter fiber bundles plays a
significant role in brain development. However, reliable and consistent
identification of these bundles from infant brain MRIs is often
challenging due to inherently low diffusion anisotropy, as well as
motion and other artifacts. In this paper we introduce a new tool for
automated probabilistic tractography specifically designed for newborn
infants. Our tool incorporates prior information about the anatomical
neighborhood of white-matter pathways from a training data set. In our
experiments, we evaluate this tool on data from both full-term and
prematurely born infants and demonstrate that it can reconstruct known
white-matter tracts in both groups robustly, even in the presence of
differences between the training set and study subjects. Additionally,
we evaluate it on a publicly available large data set of healthy term
infants (UNC Early Brain Development Program). This paves the way for
performing a host of sophisticated analyses in newborns that we have
previously implemented for the adult brain, such as pointwise analysis
along tracts and longitudinal analysis, in both health and disease.

The Human Connectome Projects in Development (HCP-D) and Aging (HCP-A)
are two large-scale brain imaging studies that will extend the recently
completed HCP Young-Adult (HCP-YA) project to nearly the full lifespan,
collecting structural, resting-state fMRI, task-fMRI, diffusion, and
perfusion MRI in participants from 5 to 100+ years of age. HCP-D is
enrolling 1300+ healthy children, adolescents, and young adults (ages
5-21), and HCP-A is enrolling 1200+ healthy adults (ages 36-100+), with
each study collecting longitudinal data in a subset of individuals at
particular age ranges. The imaging protocols of the HCP-D and HCP-A
studies are very similar, differing primarily in the selection of
different task-fMRI paradigms. We strove to harmonize the imaging
protocol to the greatest extent feasible with the completed HCP-YA
(1200+ participants, aged 22-35), but some imaging-related changes were
motivated or necessitated by hardware changes, the need to reduce the
total amount of scanning per participant, and/or the additional
challenges of working with young and elderly populations. Here, we
provide an overview of the common HCP-D/A imaging protocol including
data and rationales for protocol decisions and changes relative to
HCP-YA. The result will be a large, rich, multi-modal, and freely
available set of consistently acquired data for use by the scientific
community to investigate and define normative developmental and aging
related changes in the healthy human brain.

Multi-site brain MRI analysis is needed in big data neuroimaging
studies, but challenging. The challenges lie in almost every analysis
step including skull stripping. The diversities in multi-site brain MR
images make it difficult to tune parameters specific to subjects or
imaging protocols. Alternatively, using constant parameter settings
often leads to inaccurate, inconsistent and even failed skull stripping
results. One reason is that images scanned at different sites, under
different scanners or protocols, and/or by different technicians often
have very different fields of view (FOVs). Normalizing FOV is currently
done manually or using ad hoc pre-processing steps, which do not always
generalize well to multi-site diverse images. In this paper, we show
that (a) a generic FOV normalization approach is possible in multi-site
diverse images; we show experiments on images acquired from Philips, GE,
Siemens scanners, from 1.0T, 1.5T, 3.0T field of strengths, and from
subjects 0-90 years of ages; and (b) generic FOV normalization improves
skull stripping accuracy and consistency for multiple skull stripping
algorithms; we show this effect for 5 skull stripping algorithms
including FSL\'s BET, AFNI\'s 3dSkullStrip, FreeSurfer\'s HWA,
BrainSuite\'s BSE, and MASS. We have released our FOV normalization
software at <http://www.nitrc.org/projects/normalizefov> .

Epidemiological studies suggest that a single moderate-to-severe
traumatic brain injury (TBI) is associated with an increased risk of
neurodegenerative disease, including Alzheimer\'s disease (AD) and
Parkinson\'s disease (PD). Histopathological studies describe complex
neurodegenerative pathologies in individuals exposed to single
moderate-to-severe TBI or repetitive mild TBI, including chronic
traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). However, the clinicopathological links
between TBI and post-traumatic neurodegenerative diseases such as AD,
PD, and CTE remain poorly understood. Here, we describe the methodology
of the Late Effects of TBI (LETBI) study, whose goals are to
characterize chronic post-traumatic neuropathology and to identify in
vivo biomarkers of post-traumatic neurodegeneration. LETBI participants
undergo extensive clinical evaluation using National Institutes of
Health TBI Common Data Elements, proteomic and genomic analysis,
structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and
prospective consent for brain donation. Selected brain specimens undergo
ultra-high resolution ex vivo MRI and histopathological evaluation
including whole-mount analysis. Co-registration of ex vivo and in vivo
MRI data enables identification of ex vivo lesions that were present
during life. In vivo signatures of postmortem pathology are then
correlated with cognitive and behavioral data to characterize the
clinical phenotype(s) associated with pathological brain lesions. We
illustrate the study methods and demonstrate proof of concept for this
approach by reporting results from the first LETBI participant, who
despite the presence of multiple in vivo and ex vivo pathoanatomic
lesions had normal cognition and was functionally independent until her
mid-80s. The LETBI project represents a multidisciplinary effort to
characterize post-traumatic neuropathology and identify in vivo
signatures of postmortem pathology in a prospective study.

Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies have shown that prenatal exposure
to methamphetamine is associated with alterations in white matter
microstructure, but to date no tractography studies have been performed
in neonates. The striato-thalamo-orbitofrontal circuit and its
associated limbic-striatal areas, the primary circuit responsible for
reinforcement, has been postulated to be dysfunctional in drug
addiction. This study investigated potential white matter changes in the
striatal-orbitofrontal circuit in neonates with prenatal methamphetamine
exposure. Mothers were recruited antenatally and interviewed regarding
methamphetamine use during pregnancy, and DTI sequences were acquired in
the first postnatal month. Target regions of interest were manually
delineated, white matter bundles connecting pairs of targets were
determined using probabilistic tractography in AFNI-FATCAT, and
fractional anisotropy (FA) and diffusion measures were determined in
white matter connections. Regression analysis showed that increasing
methamphetamine exposure was associated with reduced FA in several
connections between the striatum and midbrain, orbitofrontal cortex, and
associated limbic structures, following adjustment for potential
confounding variables. Our results are consistent with previous findings
in older children and extend them to show that these changes are already
evident in neonates. The observed alterations are likely to play a role
in the deficits in attention and inhibitory control frequently seen in
children with prenatal methamphetamine exposure.
