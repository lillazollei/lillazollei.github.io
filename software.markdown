Infant FreeSurfer is an open-source software project that provides tools for processing, analyzing, and visualizing structural neuroimaging data from infants. It is a fork of the FreeSurfer project, which was originally developed for adult brains. Infant FreeSurfer includes tools for skull stripping, bias field correction, segmentation of gray and white matter, and cortical surface reconstruction. It also includes tools for analyzing functional MRI data and diffusion tensor imaging data.


Infant FreeSurfer was developed by a team of researchers at the Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. The project was funded by the National Institutes of Health.

Infant FreeSurfer is a valuable resource for the neuroimaging community. It is freely available, easy to use, and powerful. Infant FreeSurfer has helped to advance the field of neuroimaging by making it possible to analyze structural neuroimaging data from infants in a detailed and automated way.

The Infant FreeSurfer project is still under development, but it has already been used to study a variety of topics related to infant brain development. For example, it has been used to study the effects of preterm birth on brain development, the effects of environmental toxins on brain development, and the effects of genetic disorders on brain development.

The Infant FreeSurfer project is a valuable tool for researchers who are studying infant brain development. It is freely available and easy to use, and it provides a powerful set of tools for processing, analyzing, and visualizing structural neuroimaging data from infants.
