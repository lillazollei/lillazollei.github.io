# Research Interests



![DrZollei](/assets/logo.jpg){: .align-left}


I am interested in algorithm development related to perinatal brain MRI image
analysis, both for in vivo and ex vivo acquisitions. I have focused a lot on
various spatial registration projects and also on diffusion weighted image
analysis.
